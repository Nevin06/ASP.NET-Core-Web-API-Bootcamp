DbContext
The heart of EF Core

1) Represents your session with the database
0:18
Db Sets
	(Address, Student, Professor, Class) -> (Address, Student, Professor, Class)
	Entity types				For each of this entity type, you have 1 Db Set in your DbContext
2) Db Set then represents all the entities you can work on your data source
0:52
DbContext is designed as a UOW(Unit of Work)
3) You have entities and you do changes on them, do all these changes locally, DbContext keeps track of them
Call one method(eg: Save changes) , all the changes in your DbContext are persisted to your Database
DbContext is a short lived instance(load your entities, do your buisness case, close the connection, 
dispose the dbcontext and start with a fresh one)
