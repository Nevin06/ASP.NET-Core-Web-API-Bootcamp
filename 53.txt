Middlewares
Pipeline
Middleware1 -> Middleware2 -> Middleware3 -> Endpoint

1) Before the endpoint method in our controller is called, ASP.NET core calls middleware for each request
2) Can build a pipeline using these middlewares

Cancellation
Middleware1 -> Middleware2 -> Auth Middleware => Not Authorized -> 403 Response

3)Build in Middlewares in ASP.Net core like 
	1)Authentication & Authorization Middleware
	2) Cross Origin Resource Sharing(CORS)
	3)Header Propagation (HTTP request contain certain header, can propagate it when you are using http clients
	to call another API in ur backend, then you can propagate headers from ur request to the request you are
	sending HTTP client and ASP.Net core
	4) HTTPS Redirection
	5) HTTP Logging(This Middleware is logging all http requests and http responses)
	6) Single Page Application(Important if we have an app containing our API , containg our client application
	in Angular/ React)
