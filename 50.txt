1)Enable OpenAPI support
	Adds visual documentation to our projects so we can view our API in the browser
	it can act as our API caller endpoints, view the response and so on
	
2) launchSettings.json
	"launchBrowser": true -> launches browser automatically when your API is running
	"launchUrl": "swagger" -> visual documentation
3) iis -> Internet Information Services -> Web Server created by Microsoft that supports ASP.NET core
	Deploy it in iis running in your server
4) Going to use light weight web server called Kesro(standout for ASP.Net core when u are running it in ur solution
5) Controllers are the core of ASP.NET core because they provide the endpoints for our API
	Route is the endpoint of the controller
	[Route("[controller]")] -> Route to this controller is WeatherForecast
	[HttpGet(Name = "GetWeatherForecast")] -> Get endpoint
6) appsettings.json
	"AllowedHosts": "*" -> which IPs Kesro should allow connection from , if we are running it as a public server
7) Program.cs 
	entrypoint of API/application
	run everytime you start ur web server/ run ur application on the web server
