1) We need to build controller for this entity
2) We will have different endpoints
	eg: for getting these employees we have 2 different endpoints,
		one for getting a list of employees, 				 -> We only need ids, firstname, 
										lastname
										not the jobs/teams/addresses they 
										have
										=> Different classes for different
										purposes
										(Employee List)
						maybe a filtered list and	-> Filter thay we want to send for 
										this employee list
										(Employee Filter)
										eg: Filters for first name/address/
										job
		one for details of the employee for a single employee
										-> We can add jobs/teams/addresses
										(Employee Details)
=> Different representations of our employee that we want to send to our API/ want API to return to client
(EmployeeCreate) => No need to send identifier as employee doesn't exist so far. 
										-> job,address, firstname,lastname
										but not Id
(EmployeeUpdate)									-> send representation with Id
(EmployeeDelete)								-> only Id
