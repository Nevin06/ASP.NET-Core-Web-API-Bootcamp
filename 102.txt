Logging
1) Analyze errors and the performance bottlenecks and so on of your software
2) Serilog framework for logging
	1) Extensible, flexible
	2) Always add other logging providers later(say alc logging -> contains 3 components
									1) Elastic search(which enables you to 
									quickly search through logs
							Kebano -> Front-end web UI that you can use to view logs
								and interact with them
							Logstash -> Sends your log to the Elasticsearch server
								Send logs to console so that logstash can grab 
								these logs and send them to Elastic Search
							Also can later log to a file, db
	3) Switch between these methods and it also allows to have several of these logging methods at the same
	time
	4) Use logging scopes -> Start logging scope -> Add something to the scope which identifies the request
