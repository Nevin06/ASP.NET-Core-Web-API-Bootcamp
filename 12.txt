Asynchronous Programming

1) Execute code without blocking your Application

Synchronous Execution(Blocking)
0:22
In ASP .NET core , we have a thread pool(has limited no of threads)
5th thread can execute only after 4 threads complete their long running operation

Asynchronous Execution(Non Blocking)
1:35
Releasing thread again so that the 5th thread can be instantly processed by our server

1) status of this method is "Task" because we want to release this method
2) once it reaches "await", pauses method and returns the Task with status "incomplete"
3) AddressRepository is waiting for response from database
4) once db is responding, we continue with return statement
