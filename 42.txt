The 2 Approaches
Code First and Database First

Why 2 approaches?
Sometimes the Db already exists

1) If Db doesn't exist, go with Code first approach 
	1) Create Entity Classes (C# classes to define data model)
		2) Create DbContext
			3) Create Migration (created by entity framework core)
				Tell EFCore to create a migration using Entity Classes & DbContext-> Migration file
				Use this migration file with EFCore to generate/create ur DB

	1)Changes to ur Entity classes
				3)Create next migration
	Entity framework will look at what differences are there with the Entity framework and ur DB and creates 
	right migration file
	Run the migration file and changes will be applied to DB

2) DB First approach
[Not recommended if you already have a DB]
	1) Create DB schema(Don't need to do this if you already have one)
		2) (EFCore provides command to) Generate Entities and DbContext
						create	(classes)
