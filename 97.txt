File Service
1) When creating Web APIs, often need to work with files
	eg: employees to have a profile photo,etc
2) File upload & download -> store files in our project(local file system)
3) Later Azure blob storage

Task in hand:
Implement a profile photo so that our employees can have a profile photo
Make this profile photo optional(not every employee has to have a profile photo)

1) Extend Model Employee.cs
2) Dto to be able to upload a profile photo and assign it to this employee in ProfilePhotoUpdate.cs
	IFormFile -> representation of file we're uploading
3) Interface with which we can save files, delete files, get files IFileService.cs
4) Implement FileService.cs in Infrastructure layer
