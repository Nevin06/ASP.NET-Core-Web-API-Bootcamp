Create the App Service
1) An app service is just a fully managed web hosting service and we can use the service to host our API

Create a resource -> app service(search) -> Web App

2) Deployment Tab
Don't want to use continuous deployment because we are just going to deploy Web application from visual studio

3) Monitoring Tab
Enable Application Insights -> This is just for logging and some metrics about our application

Publish our course project to this app service
