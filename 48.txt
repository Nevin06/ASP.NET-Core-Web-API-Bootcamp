Repository pattern
1) Pattern that enables us to decouple our buisness logic(business layer) from our data access layer.
2) Business layer shouldn't deal with the db concerns
3) Call 1 method to call students from the db or update the db

4) Don't want to depend on the dbContext directly in our business layer because we just want an interface here
to mock that and just test that.
